A frustrating game that nobody should play. You are a purple block, trying to avoid the red blocks, obtaining the yellow blocks and making it to the end.

## Controls

- `WASD` or `Arrow Keys` to move
- Hold `Shift` to dash
- `Space` to jump

## How to play

- Avoid the red blocks
- Obtain the yellow blocks for 10 points
- Make it to the end of the level, blue block

If you hit a red block, you will go back to the start of the current level and you loose 5 points
